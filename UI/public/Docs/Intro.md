# STEM Competitions

Welcome to STEM Competitions!  This website provides educational STEM design competitions of various types, involving physics, math, and engineering. 

## The Big Picture
To participate, you create a team (including teams of one if you want to work individually), and submit a design.  The site determines if your design is correct, and either gives you hints on what needs fixing, or simulates your design on the problem and gives it a quality score.

### Simulations

Realistic simulation of each design problem, and of your solution to it, is a
major feature of the site.  Whether it's a gravitational bounce challenge, an elastic-collisions cannon, or a bridge design, you get both a schematic movie
of your design being tested, and a CGI 3-D movie of it (with VR enhancement if you have VR goggles).

### Some Example Design Competitions
Here are some example competitions

#### Bounce
In this competition you launch balls at speeds you determine in order to hit targets.  The competition involves gravitational kinematics and elastic collisions.  Full details are [here](Cmps/Bounce/Instructions.html)

#### Land Grab
Start with a rectanglar space, filled with rectangular obstacles.  Grab as much of the free space as possible by picking circles of "territory" that fall within the space and avoid the obstacles and each other.

#### Rebound
Build a ["Galilean cannon"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galilean_cannon) by arranging collisions of different-mass balls to fire the lightest one at the highest possible speed.
