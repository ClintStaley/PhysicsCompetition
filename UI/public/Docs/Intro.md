# STEM Competitions

Welcome to STEM Competitions!  This website provides educational design competitions in physics, math, and engineering. 


## Simulations

Realistic simulation of your designs is a major feature of the site.  You get both a schematic movieof your design being tested, a CGI 3-D movie of it, and
even a VR view in 3D if you have VR goggles.

## Some Example Competitions
We have a range of design competitions, for instance

### Bounce
In this competition you launch balls to hit targets.  The competition involves gravitational kinematics and elastic collisions. 

### Land Grab
Start with a rectanglar space, filled with rectangular obstacles.  Grab as much of the free space as possible by picking nonoverlapping circles of "territory" that fall within the space.

### Rebound
Build a ["Galilean cannon"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galilean_cannon) by arranging collisions of different balls to fire the lightest one at the highest possible speed.

## Tutorial Walkthrough

Our [example walkthrough](Walkthrough.html) of a Bounce competition will show you how this all works.
