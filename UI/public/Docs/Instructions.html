<h2 dir="auto" id="managing-teams">Managing Teams</h2>
<p dir="auto">The Teams tab lets you manage your teams and team memberships.  It shows each team of which you are a member, with buttons to the right allowing modification of team details if you are the team's lead.</p>
<p dir="auto">You can expand each team to see its members.  If you're team lead, you can remove any other team member via trashcan buttons to the right  If you're not lead, then you can remove just yourself from the team via the trashcan button to the right.</p>
<p dir="auto">Team leads can add members via the &quot;plus&quot; button, edit the team details via the edit button, and even delete the team, via the delete button on the team (not on the individual members).

<h3 dir="auto" id="detailed-results">Detailed Results</h3>
<p dir="auto">For some competitions, you also get a numerically-detailed summary of your design, which may be more useful for analyzing your results.</p>
<h3 dir="auto" id="submitting-a-design">Submitting a Design</h3>
<p dir="auto">The Make First/Another Attempt button on the Submit Page pops up a dialog via which you may enter a new design submission.  Once you do this, it may take several seconds for the submission to be graded.  The page will show you a message indicating that it's checking for a result, and then will show the result once your submission is graded.</p>
