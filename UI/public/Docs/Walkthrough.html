<p dir="auto">You can try out a competition without even registering on the site if you like.  Simply log in as &quot;guest&quot;, with an empty password.  Then follow these steps</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">
<p dir="auto">Click the Join Competitions option, and click Show Competitions in the Bounce tab.  The first competition that shows should be &quot;Example Bounce Competition&quot;.</p>
</li>
<li dir="auto">
<p dir="auto">Click Join for the Example Bounce Competition.  There will be many existing teams, but create a new one via the Create Team button, giving it a different title than the others.  You can use your Email or just your full name.  You'll be the only member of your &quot;team&quot;.</p>
</li>
<li dir="auto">
<p dir="auto">Now choose Active Competitions on the upper left, and you should see Example Bounce Competition as your one active competition.  Click &quot;status&quot; for this competition to see the team you created, and click Submit/check by that team, to actually work on the competition.</p>
</li>
<li dir="auto">
<p dir="auto">Now go to <a href="./Cmps/Bounce/Hints/Intro/Index.html">the hints for this competition</a>.  They'll give you exact answers, so you can try out the competition.</p>
