<h2 dir="auto" id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p dir="auto">Basic bounce competitions have just one target with no barriers, and can be
solved with a single ball launch.</p>
<h2 dir="auto" id="suggested-playing-strategy">Suggested Playing Strategy</h2>
<h3 dir="auto" id="see-the-hints-from-the-general-instructinos-for-the-competition">See the hints from the general instructinos for the competition</h3>
<p dir="auto">Those hints are broadly useful and worth review.</p>
<h3 dir="auto" id="make-a-best-guess">Make a best guess</h3>
<p dir="auto">If you're not sure how to proceed, try one or two random, one-ball, guesses and see how
the ball falls.  You can always solve the problem by repeated guesses, though you'll
lose score for too many such guesses.</p>
<h3 dir="auto" id="make-a-calculated-guess">Make a calculated guess</h3>
<p dir="auto">Consider how long it will take the ball to drop to the height of the target.
(Don't forget that the ball center will be 10cm above the target when it hits
since the ball has a 10cm radius.)  From this, figure out a speed that will
move horizontally to the centerline of the target during that drop time.  Remember
that vertical behavior is independent of horizontal: the ball will take the same
amount of time to fall to the level of the target regardless of how fast it's
moving horizontally.</p>
<h3 dir="auto" id="speeding-up-the-solution">Speeding up the solution</h3>
<p dir="auto">The faster you hit all the targets, the better the score. So, once you've got a
working solution, refine it by getting the ball to hit on the rightmost end of the
target (which would give the ball the fastest horizontal speed, so it exits the
area as quickly as possible)</p>
