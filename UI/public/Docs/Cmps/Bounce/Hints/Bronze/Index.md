# Hints for Bronze Bounce Competition

## Overview
Bronze bounce competitions have several targets, and one or more barriers,
but can still be solved with a single ball launch.

## Suggested Playing Strategy

### Try hitting just one target for each ball
You can always start by hitting one target at a time, using a different ball for
each.  This won't get you 100%, but it's a start.

### Hit multiple targets with a single ball
Hitting multiple targets per ball requires several new ideas.

#### Vertical bounces
Vertical bounces off a target reverse the *vertical* component of the ball's velocity, leaving the horizontal velocity unchanged.  And,
since it's an elastic collision, the ball will rise back up to the original 10m
height after a vertical bounce, and will take the same amount of time to rise
as it did to fall.  Use this to determine how long it will take the ball to rise and then fall again to hit the second target.

#### Horizontal speed ranges
Once you know the rise/fall times and thus the times the ball will hit each
target, consider the min/max ranges of horizontal velocity needed to hit the
left and right ends of each target.  Pick a horizontal velocity that fits in
all the ranges.  And of course, pick the fastest such horizontal velocity for
the best score.

### Don't forget the barriers
But... don't forget the barriers.  These will always be placed in such a way
as to limit your choices of horizontal velocity.
