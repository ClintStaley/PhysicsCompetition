<h1 dir="auto" id="stem-competitions">STEM Competitions</h1>
<p dir="auto">Welcome to STEM Competitions!  This website provides educational STEM design competitions of various types, involving physics, math, and engineering.</p>
<h2 dir="auto" id="the-big-picture">The Big Picture</h2>
<p dir="auto">To participate, you create a team (including teams of one if you want to work individually), and submit a design.  The site determines if your design is correct, and either gives you hints on what needs fixing, or simulates your design on the problem and gives it a quality score.</p>
<h3 dir="auto" id="simulations">Simulations</h3>
<p dir="auto">Realistic simulation of each design problem, and of your solution to it, is a
major feature of the site.  Whether it's a gravitational bounce challenge, an elastic-collisions cannon, or a bridge design, you get both a schematic movie
of your design being tested, and a CGI 3-D movie of it (with VR enhancement if you have VR goggles).</p>
<h3 dir="auto" id="some-example-design-competitions">Some Example Design Competitions</h3>
<p dir="auto">Here are some example competitions</p>
<h4 dir="auto" id="bounce">Bounce</h4>
<p dir="auto">In this competition you launch balls at speeds you determine in order to hit targets.  The competition involves gravitational kinematics and elastic collisions.  Full details are <a href="Cmps/Bounce/Instructions.html">here</a></p>
<h4 dir="auto" id="land-grab">Land Grab</h4>
<p dir="auto">Start with a rectanglar space, filled with rectangular obstacles.  Grab as much of the free space as possible by picking circles of &quot;territory&quot; that fall within the space and avoid the obstacles and each other.</p>
<h4 dir="auto" id="rebound">Rebound</h4>
<p dir="auto">Build a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galilean_cannon">&quot;Galilean cannon&quot;</a> by arranging collisions of different-mass balls to fire the lightest one at the highest possible speed.</p>
