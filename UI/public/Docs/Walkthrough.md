# Competition Walkthrough

You can try out a competition without even registering on the site if you like.  Simply log in as "guest", with an empty password.  Then follow these steps

1. Click the Join Competitions option, and click Show Competitions in the Bounce tab.  The first competition that shows should be "Example Bounce Competition".

2. Click Join for the Example Bounce Competition.  There will be many existing teams, but create a new one via the Create Team button, giving it a different title than the others.  You can use your Email or just your full name.  You'll be the only member of your "team".

3. Now choose Active Competitions on the upper left, and you should see Example Bounce Competition as your one active competition.  Click "status" for this competition to see the team you created, and click Submit/check by that team, to actually work on the competition.

4. Now go to [the hints for this competition](./Cmps/Bounce/Hints/Intro/Index.html).  They'll give you exact answers, so you can try out the competition.
