# STEM Competitions

This website provides educational STEM design competitions.  You create a team (including teams of one if you want to work individually) for a competition, and submit a design.  The site determines if your design is correct, and either
gives you hints on what needs fixing, or simulates your design on the problem
and gives it a quality score.

## Simulations

Realistic simulation of each design problem, and of your solution to it, is a
major feature of the site.  Whether it's a gravitational bounce challenge, an elastic-collisions cannon, or a bridge design, you get both a schematic movie
of your design at work, and a CGI 3-D movie of it (with VR enhancement if you
have VR goggles).

## Some Example Design Competitions
Here are some example competitions

### Bounce
In this competition you launch balls a speeds you determine in order to hit targets.  The competition involves gravitational kinematics and elastic collitions.  Full details are [here](Cmps/Bounce/Instructions.html)

## How to get started
