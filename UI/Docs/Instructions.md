#STEM Competition Site

## Overview
This instruction page tells you how to register for the site, sign in, create and join teams, and participate in competitions.  For details on each particular competition, see the instructions linked from that competition's page.

## Registering and Logging in
Registering and logging in works in the usual fashion.  Click the Register tab to fill in basic information and a password.  You'll need an Email to use as your login name.  The Site Terms page is [Terms.html]("here").

## Competitions
Once you've logged in, the site shows you the Active Competitions tab, which lists competitions you're current participating in.  When you first log in this will be empty. To participate, you must either join an existing team, or create one of your own (which can be just yourself as a team of one if you want).

### Joining a Competition
The Join Competitions tab shows all competitions that you can join.  Click <b>Join this Competition</b> under a competition name to get information on that competition, including instructions for the competition and the teams participating.  Expanding each team will show the current team members, including the team lead.  Contact the team lead to get added to an existing team, or create a team of your own, with you as leader, via the Create Team button.  Once you're part of a team that is competing, the relevant competition will show under your Active Competitions tab.

## Managing Teams
The Teams tab lets you manage your teams and team memberships.  It shows each team of which you are a member, with buttons to the right allowing modification of team details if you are the team's lead.  

You can expand each team to see its members.  If you're team lead, you can remove any other team member via trashcan buttons to the right  If you're not lead, then you can remove just yourself from the team via the trashcan button to the right.  

Team leads can add members via the "plus" button, edit the team details via the edit button, and even delete the team, via the delete button on the team (not on the individual members).  Editing a team allows changing the team name, and also giving leadership to another member of the team.  (If you are lead, you you must assign leadership to another member before you can remove yourself from the team.)

## Checking on a Competition's Status
To see how you and other teams are doing in a competition, click the Competition Status button on the relevant competition in the Active Competitions page.  This leads to a status page for that competition.

### Competition Status
The Competition Status page shows the status of each team signed up for the competition, including team details and most recent score.  For any team you are a part of it also provides a Submit/Check button, which leads to a Submission Page.

## Submission Page
The Submission Page shows a diagram of the competition problem, and if relevant, gives you information on your team's best score so far, and their most recent design submission for the competition in question, including time/date of submission and score awarded.

### Design Movie
The Submission Page provides a movie of the outcome of your submission, in either schematic or full 3-D form.   You can play, stop, and replay the movie animation of your submission via buttons on the left, and switch between Diagram and 3D representations.

### Detailed Results
For some competitions, you also get a numerically-detailed summary of your design, which may be more useful for analyzing your results.

### Submitting a Design
The Make First/Another Attempt button on the Submit Page pops up a dialog via which you may enter a new design submission.  Once you do this, it may take several seconds for the submission to be graded.  The page will show you a message indicating that it's checking for a result, and then will show the result once your submission is graded.
