<h1 dir="auto" id="stem-competitions">STEM Competitions</h1>
<p dir="auto">This website provides educational STEM design competitions.  You create a team (including teams of one if you want to work individually) for a competition, and submit a design.  The site determines if your design is correct, and either
gives you hints on what needs fixing, or simulates your design on the problem
and gives it a quality score.</p>
<h2 dir="auto" id="simulations">Simulations</h2>
<p dir="auto">Realistic simulation of each design problem, and of your solution to it, is a
major feature of the site.  Whether it's a gravitational bounce challenge, an elastic-collisions cannon, or a bridge design, you get both a schematic movie
of your design at work, and a CGI 3-D movie of it (with VR enhancement if you
have VR goggles).</p>
<h2 dir="auto" id="some-example-design-competitions">Some Example Design Competitions</h2>
<p dir="auto">Here are some example competitions</p>
<h3 dir="auto" id="bounce">Bounce</h3>
<p dir="auto">In this competition you launch balls a speeds you determine in order to hit targets.  The competition involves gravitational kinematics and elastic collitions.  Full details are <a href="Cmps/Bounce/Instructions.html">here</a></p>
<h2 dir="auto" id="how-to-get-started">How to get started</h2>
<p dir="auto">Register at <a href="http://www.softwareinventions.com/PhysicsCompetition">the competition site</a>, and follow <a href="Instructions.html">these directions</a>.</p>
