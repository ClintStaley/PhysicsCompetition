        CAS FIX: Need a type 3 against the obstacle as well as the target.  And let's call type 3 a collision
        with target, and type 4 a collision with obstacle.  They're coded differently in the movie players, so
        may as well have different types.  Issue is edited accordingly.

        You also need a type 5 and 6, so you can properly design the player for launches and ball exits.  Both
        require scenegraph adjustments.

        And, the collisions ought to put the ball in contact with the obstacle/target.  Yours doesn't.  Ball should 
        be radius-distance away, I think we had the radii as 5 cm or .05 m.
