<h2 class="western">Overview</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The STEM competition
website offers STEM design competitions with the following common
elements. Several specific examples are below.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<ol>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Automated
	generation of STEM design challenges of various types.</p>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Required use
	of mathematical/scientific principles to precisely predict the
	performance of a submitted design.</p>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Online
	animation showing a test of the design, with precise quantitative
	results.</p>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">An
	opportunity to improveme the design, but with requirements and
	limits that preclude mere cut-and-try development without deeper
	analysis.</p>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Random
	generation of problem parameters, to provide an unlimited number of
	design challenges of the same type.</p>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">(Optional)
	Team work and/or team competitions</p>
</ol>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The website provides
the student with a description, both textual and diagrammatic, of a
design challenge, and allows the student to enter a solution,
including an exact description of the expected behavior of the
solution, derived from mathematical analysis of the problem. The site
responds with a simulated run of the design, generally in the form of
a sketch-animation of the design&rsquo;s performance, with associated
quantitative information regarding the design run. The student may
then resubmit an improved design, up to some limit of repetitions.</p>

<h2 class="western">Two Example Competitions</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

<h4 class="western">Bounce</h4>

</p>
<h2 class="western">How Does This Differ from Similar Sites</h2>
<p>There are other STEM design-competition websites, most notably
...., which closely imitates traditional physics design competitions
like model plane design or bridge building, with an added element of
CAD-style design. XXX differs from these in several respects</p>
<ol>
	<li/>
<p>A focus on quantitative, rather than qualitative, design
	and analysis. Physical competitions, and the virtual competitions
	offered by sites like ...., both teach broad principles, e.g. that
	some bridge members are under tension while others are under
	compression. But students do not generally analyze their designs
	using mathematical principles, nor arrive at precise and verifiable
	predictions of design performance. Each XXX design competition
	requires mathematical analysis, and offers students the rewarding
	experience of predicting an outcome using scientific and engineering
	principles, and seeing their predictions prove numerically accurate.</p>
	<li/>
<p>Smaller challenges, appropriate for large homework
	assignments, rather than multiweek projects. Smaller challenges
	allow a faster learning cycle, and allow time for several different
	design challenges, empasizing different concepts.</p>
	<li/>
<p>Available without charge</p>
