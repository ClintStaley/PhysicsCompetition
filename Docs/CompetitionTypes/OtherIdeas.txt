Comments on WhiteBoxLearning

 * We both agree it's quite sophisticated and nicely done.
 * Jake didn't find the history or physical construction components compelling.
   Liked CAD tool and especially the simulation. 
 * Clint doesn't care for the CAD tool as it seems to invite rote incremental
   parameter tweaking and it does all the math for you rather than requiring
   you to do the computation.
 * Both didn't care for rigid design parameters.

What we could do that is different
  * Open-ended creative problem that requires analysis
  * Shape binpacking, rocket slalom (with various target points in maze), space division
  * Jake suggested tower block building

Other interesting properties
  * Teamwork.  Couldn't see any need for the system to accommodate this
    unless there was some model that didn't allow team members to readily
	communicate on their own.
  * Competition.  This seemed doable for many of the ideas
    * For bin-packing, try to be the last one to place an item
    * For space division, draw from limited pool of shapes
	* For rocket slalom, try to grab as many targets as possible, or possibly
	  some variation on Snake videogame
  * Both liked Reddit's r/place, and would like to do some math/physics
    version of this, but couldn't immediately come up with an idea.
  * Speed, e.g. making bin packing into a Tetris-style game

Open questions
  * Way to make a crowdsourced physics/engineering activity?
  * What specific concepts do we want to try to teach?
